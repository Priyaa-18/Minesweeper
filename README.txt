------------------------------------- README -------------------------------------

This project is done by:
— Priya Sisodia (sisod008)
— Sean Swart (swart209)

Contributions:
— We both made all the methods together

How to Compile and Run:
— We created the classes in IntelliJ IDEA, where we can run our program inside the in-built Terminal directly

Assumptions:
— The status of the cell changes to "F", when the user puts a flag on the cell, and it cannot be reversed back to any
other status whatsoever

Additional Features implemented:
— Used String.format to make the rows and columns align equally with each other

Known bugs or defects:
— If the user puts a flag on a cell, it permanently changes the status of that cell to "F". But if the previous status
is not a mine, then it makes this game a little bit different from the actual Minesweeper game.

Outside sources:
— Java Documentation

I certify that the information contained in this README file is complete and accurate.
I have both read and followed the course policies in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’
section of the course syllabus.
